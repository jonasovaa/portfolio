                    <p>UnDrop is a fictional clothing brand, focused on designing trendy, durable rain coats.  In this project I was a part of the research team as well as a project manager.

                <p>Swing it is a fictional project. In this project we were passed on a project from another group and our task was to improve it. As a group we did a lot of research to match the needs of our  target group. Other than that  I was in charge of designing the logo. I also coded my portion of the website <a href="http://valentyna.world/swingit/faq.html" target="blank">(FAQ page). </a> </p>
